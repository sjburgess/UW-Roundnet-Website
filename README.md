## Sprint Review
1. We learned how to collaborate on a coding project at the same time using GitHub. We also learned how to delegate tasks throughout the team to make sure each team member has work to do that is suited to their skills.
2. Our communication was effective due to regular updates via iMessage and scheduled meetings.
3. The main challenge for this sprint was deciding what tasks to try to complete. We did not want to rush too far ahead into this project, but we also wanted to complete a significant amount of work. It was difficult to determine how much work was enough, without going too fast.
4. For the next sprint, we plan to spend more time at the beginning of the sprint determining the delegation of tasks. We will have a more in depth sprint intialization meeting in order to divide tasks equally.
5. Yes, we are satisfied with what we completed for this sprint.
