## Sprint Review

**What did you learn from this sprint?** One of the biggest challenges we faced was managing our workload from other classes while staying on track with sprint tasks. Coding communication and the use of branches were also areas where we struggled; for example, there were moments when updates weren’t consistently shared across the team. To overcome this, we prioritized clear check-ins and relied on Trello and iMessage to align on goals. Additionally, some coding aspects of user authentication required more time than expected, so we adjusted by redistributing smaller tasks to balance the workload.

**What did go well? Why?** We were able to finish all tasks on time and ensure that the user authentication was fully functional. Our team demonstrated strong commitment to meeting deadlines and worked collaboratively to fill in gaps when needed. Communication through iMessage and task tracking in Trello helped keep us organized and accountable. 

**What didn’t go well? Why not?** There are a few areas we’d like to improve: Branching and Code Communication: We need to better document and communicate what each team member is working on to avoid overlap or confusion. Time Management: While we met deadlines, better planning could reduce last-minute stress.

**How can you make things better next time?** We’re planning to implement more regular updates and check-ins during the next sprint to address these challenges.

**Are you satisfied with what you already completed?** Yes, we completed a lot of work during this sprint. We had a few people review or give feedback on things which helped to streamline some of the proccesses. We feel that out site is in good standing and where able to polish up some areas that needed improvement.
