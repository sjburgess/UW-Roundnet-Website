## Project Prototype
We have created interactive prototypes for the website using Justinmind. You can view the prototype by [clicking here](https://cloud.justinmind.com/usernote/prototype/e500a8d55122c1afa6324bf97956c677cf59c9bacd1d98fce1fa10a35f9b58d4).
Please see the files section for our HTML, CSS, and JS prototype.

## Daily Scrum

## Sprint Review
1. We learned how to break down tasks and collaborate effectively using Trello. We also learned more about how to effectively use the burndown chart powerup. 
2. Our communication was effective due to regular updates via iMessage and scheduled meetings.
3. Time estimation was a challenge. We underestimated some tasks. One specific thing that didn't go well was the use of the burndown chart to follow progress. While this was our first time using the burndown chart, we realized that creating task cards during the spring produced weird effects on the burndown chart making it less straightforward and useful. 
4. For the next sprint, we plan to dedicate more time to sprint planning and time estimation. Another thing we will be working on for the next sprint is to try and create all our task cards at the beginning of the sprint to make sure the burndown chart accurately represents our work.
5. Yes, we are satisfied with what we completed for Sprint 1.
6. Group 2 was invited to review. Feedback is below

   "
   
      Things Group 3 did well:
   
         - Their Trello board was laid out neatly and effectively
   
         - Listing out practical user stories and linking those stories to your task breakdown chart
   
         - Creating a robust task breakdown chart, and linking that to your Trello
   
         - Adding detailed descriptions in your Scrum meetings
   
      Things Group 3 could improve upon:
   
         - Attaching/adjusting the margin on your burndown chart pictures
   
         - Completing your Scrum meeting notes
   
         - Incorporating CSS / JS to your website, or if they have done that, commit the changes to GitHub for review.
   
   Great work!
