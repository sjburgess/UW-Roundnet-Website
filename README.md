## Sprint Review

### Sprint Review Questions  

**1. What did you learn from this sprint?**  
We learned how to finalize and host a web application using Firebase, configure detailed security rules, and perform end-to-end testing with Puppeteer to ensure functionality. This sprint also reinforced the importance of clean and efficient code for user authentication and CRUD operations.  

**2. What did go well? Why?**  
Finalizing the hosting and security rules went very smoothly because we had a clear understanding of Firebase tools and prioritized thorough testing. Additionally, our collaboration on refining the buttons and implementing functionalities for board members was efficient, thanks to clear task delegation.  

**3. What didn’t go well? Why not?**  
The Puppeteer testing phase took longer than expected due to some initial unfamiliarity with configuring the testing environment. We resolved this by allocating extra time to debugging and referencing documentation, but it did cause minor delays.  

**4. How can you make things better next time?**  
Though there is no next sprint, we recognized the value of planning additional time for testing and team check-ins. Improved communication about individual progress would have further streamlined the process, ensuring we were always aligned.  

**5. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?**  
Yes, we are very satisfied. The site is fully functional, secure, and hosted online, meeting all user story requirements and exceeding our initial goals.
